Such flooding is characterized\n               by ponding or sheet flow.\n\n               \"Area of special flood hazard\" - see \"special flood hazard area.\"\n\n               \"Base flood\" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded\n               in any given year (also called the \"100-year flood\"). Base flood is the term used\n               throughout this chapter.\n\n               \"Base flood elevation\" (BFE) means the elevation shown on the FIRM for Zones AE, AH,\n               A1—30, VE and V1—V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood\n               that has a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given\n               year.\n\n               \"Basement\" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade, i.e., below ground\n               level, on all sides.\n\n               \"Building\" - see \"structure.\"\n\n               \"Development\" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including,\n               but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,\n               paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.\n\n               \"Encroachment\" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation,\n               buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede\n               or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.\n\n               \"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision\" means a manufactured home park or\n               subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which\n               the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation\n               of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring\n               of concrete pads) is completed before December 18, 1981.\n\n               \"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision\" means the preparation\n               of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which\n               the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities,\n               the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete\n               pads).\n\n               \"Flood, flooding, or flood water\" means:\n\n                  (1)\n\n                  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry\n                  land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation\n                  or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and\n\n                  (2)\n\n                  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.\n\n               \"Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)\" means the official map on which the federal\n               emergency management agency or federal insurance administration has delineated both\n               the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.\n\n               \"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)\" means the official map on which the federal emergency\n               management agency or federal insurance administration has delineated both the areas\n               of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.\n\n               \"Flood Insurance Study\" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance\n               Administration that includes flood profiles, FIRM, the flood boundary and floodway\n               map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.\n\n               \"Floodplain or Flood-Prone Area\" means any land area susceptible to being inundated\n               by water from any source - see \"flooding.\"\n\n               \"Floodplain Administrator\" is the community official designated by title to administer\n               and enforce the floodplain management regulations.\n\n               \"Floodplain Management\" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and\n               preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where\n               possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency\n               preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open\n               space plans.\n\n               \"Floodplain Management Regulations\" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances,\n               subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances\n               (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which\n               control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local\n               regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and\n               reducing flood loss and damage.\n\n               \"Floodproofing\" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes,\n               or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate\n               or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.\n               For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA technical bulletins TB 1-93,\n               TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.\n\n               \"Floodway\" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land\n               areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively\n               increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as \"regulatory\n               floodway.\"\n\n               \"Floodway fringe\" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the \"regulatory\n               floodway\" where encroachment may be permitted.\n\n               \"Fraud and victimization\" as related to this chapter, means that the variance granted\n               must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement,\n               the council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government\n               responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one-hundred\n               (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation\n               are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while\n               future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the\n               costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring.\n               In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to\n               potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.\n\n               \"Functionally dependent use\" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose\n               unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes\n               only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading\n               of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not\n               include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.\n\n               \"Governing body\" is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, empowered\n               to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general\n               welfare of its citizenry.\n\n               \"Hardship\" as related to this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result\n               from a failure to grant the requested variance. The council requires that the variance\n               be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial\n               hardship alone is not exceptional.

For guidance on flood openings, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93;\n\n                  (c)\n\n                  Crawl space construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile or column foundations\n                  that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required in V zones;\n\n                  (d)\n\n                  Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant\n                  to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawl space used\n                  to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that\n                  extend below the BFE; and\n\n                  (e)\n\n                  Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated above BFE or\n                  designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components\n                  during flood conditions.\n\n                  (f)\n\n                  Requirements for all below-grade crawl space construction, in addition to the above\n                  requirements, to include the following:\n\n                  (1)\n\n                  The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE must not be more than two (2) ft.\n                  below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (lag), shown as d in figure 3 of technical\n                  bulletin 11-01;\n\n                  (2)\n\n                  The height of the below-grade crawl space, measured from the interior grade of the\n                  crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall must not exceed four (4)\n                  ft. (shown as l in figure 3 of technical bulletin 11-01) at any point;\n\n                  (3)\n\n                  There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior\n                  area of the crawl space within a reasonable period of time after a flood event, not\n                  to exceed seventy-two (72) hours; and\n\n                  (4)\n\n                  The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five (5) feet per second\n                  for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of five (5) feet per second, other foundation\n                  types should be used.\n\n               (Ord. No. 08-666, 8-19-2008)"

    "content": "(a)\n\n               The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium\n               rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified\n               by the granting of a variance.\n\n               The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general\n               principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not\n               personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical\n               characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would\n               create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners.\n               The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels.\n               The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its\n               inhabitants, or the property owners.\n\n               It is the duty of the council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need\n               is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below\n               flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements\n               in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing\n               flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,\n               the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple\n               provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria\n               are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance\n               are more appropriate.\n\n               (b)\n\n               Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,\n               and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less\n               in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed\n               below the base flood level, providing that the procedures set forth in this chapter\n               have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical\n               justification required for issuing the variance increases.\n\n               (c)\n\n               Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of \"historic structures\"\n               (as defined in this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation\n               will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and\n               the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design\n               of the structure.\n\n               (1)\n\n               Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase\n               in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.\n\n               (2)\n\n               Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the \"minimum\n               necessary\" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. \"Minimum necessary\" means\n               to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter.\n               For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the\n               city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even\n               to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the\n               city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local\n               chapter.\n\n               (3)\n\n               Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the\n               signature of a community official that:\n\n               (a)\n\n               The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will\n               result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00\n               for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and\n\n               (b)\n\n               Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.\n               It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator\n               in the office of the Kern County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that\n               it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.\n\n               (4)\n\n               The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including\n               justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial\n               report submitted to the federal emergency management agency.\n\n               (d)\n\n               In passing upon requests for variances, the council shall consider all technical evaluations,\n               all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:\n\n               (1)\n\n               Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;\n\n               (2)\n\n               Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;\n\n               (3)\n\n               Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect\n               of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;\n               (4) Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;\n\n               (5)\n\n               Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;\n\n               (6)\n\n               Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to\n               flooding or erosion damage;\n\n               (7)\n\n               Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;\n\n               (8)\n\n               Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management\n               program for that area;\n\n               (9)\n\n               Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;\n\n               (10)\n\n               Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the\n               flood waters expected at the site;

For an application for a small residential\n               rooftop solar energy system that meets the requirements of the approved checklist\n               and standard plan, the Building Department shall issue a building permit or other\n               non-discretionary permit the same day for over-the-counter applications or within\n               3 business days for electronically filed applications. A building official may require\n               an applicant to apply for a use permit if the official finds, based on substantial\n               evidence, that the solar energy system could have a specific, adverse impact upon\n               the public health and safety.

Such findings shall include the basis for the rejection\n               of the potential feasible alternative for preventing the adverse impact. Such decisions\n               may be appealed pursuant to procedures outlined in Sections 2.64.170, 2.64.180 and\n               2.64.190 of this code.\n\n               (d)\n\n               Any condition imposed on an application shall be designed to mitigate the specific,\n               adverse impact upon health and safety at the lowest possible cost.

Proof of impending construction such as working drawings, approved construction\n               loan, monies in escrow, building plans and water meter application must be shown to\n               ensure the SDI Lot Owner is committed to improving the lot.\n\n               (c)\n\n               The SDI Advisory Committee and the City Manager shall evaluate the report of the City\n               Engineer and make recommendations to the City Council concerning the construction\n               of the SDI Improvements as part of the annual budget process.
